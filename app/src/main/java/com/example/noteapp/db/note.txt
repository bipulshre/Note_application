-Save data in a local database using Room
-Primary components:
       -The database class that holds the database and serves as
        the main access point for the underlying connection to our app's persisted data.

       -Data entities that represent tables in your app's database.

       -Data access objects (DAOs) that provide methods that our app can use to query,

        update, insert, and delete data in the database.

The database class provides our app with instances of the DAOs associated with that database.
In turn, the app can use the DAOs to retrieve data from the database as instances of the
associated data entity objects.
